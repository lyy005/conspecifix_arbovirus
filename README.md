# Analytical pipeline used to classify arboviral species based on gene flow (recombination)

This document is a walkthrough of the data and analytical pipeline used to delineate the species boundaries of arboviruses (Flaviviruses and Alphaviruses) based on Biological Species Concept (BSC). We measured the amount of gene flow by estimating the ratio between the number of homoplasic polymorphisms and the number of non-homoplasic polymorphisms (*h/m* ratio).
